#My Fabulous Recipe#

<p>This recipe for **cereal and milk** has been passed down my family for months.</p>

##Ingredients##

1. Cereal (you can find cool cereals [here]("www.example.com/coolcereals"))
2. Milk


##Directions

If I were writing these out as `code`, it might look something like this:

```
if bowl is empty:
add cereal
if bowl only has cereal in it:
add milk
```
